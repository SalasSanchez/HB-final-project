BEFORE TUESDAY:

In code_details- the url should not have a hyper link when it is 'No url'

When the submit button on the popup is clicked, the popup closes. How do I make it stay open?

Now the href from popup works, but by adding <base> to base.html, every click on main page created a new tab. 







FOR LATER:

LOTS OF JS: hovering windows with info, instead of whole new page
               
default expiry date-- no expiration

Navigation: LOG OUT?

if someone uses a code-
	the code must not be available
