Website and plugin for sharing referral codes with friends

Referraly is a webapp designed to allow users to pool their referral 
codes together and this way multiply the chances of the codes being used. The user can
store codes and see the codes that her buddies are sharing with her through the site.

When the user finds a 'refer a friend' discount on a website, she can easily store
it by using the chrome extension plugin. All codes that the user has in her wallet
are automatically made available to all her buddies. 

And when the user is browsing on a site and wonders whether she has a discount
available to her for that website, all she needs to do is click on the plugin
and she will see on the popup those codes that she can use for the page she is on.


CHROMEXT:
This folder includes the files and folders for the chrome extension. 

Apart from the icons, bootstrap, and jquery files, here are the main html file for 
the popup: popup.html; the js file that connects the plugin to the main app, which is popup.js; 
and the manifest,json file, which includes the configuration of the chrome extension as
a browser action plug in with a default popup.

The plugin's popup works so that the user can include a code to their wallet and click on the 
hyperlink of the codes available to the user.
